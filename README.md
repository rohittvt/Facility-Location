# Facility-Location
Multi-facility location problem (MFLP) is to locate certain facilities so as to serve optimally a given set of customers, whose locations and requirements are known. The simplest MFLP is when there are n demand points (customers) and we are required to: (a) determine the locations of the m facilities (location decision), and (b) assign customers to facilities (allocation or assignment),  The convex hull of a set of points is defined as the smallest convex polygon that encloses all of the points in the set. Convex polygon is the polygon which has none of its corner bent inwards.  In algorithm, Our aim is to find a set of all possible unique convex hulls and then find the functional value associated with each convex hull. The value is sum of the weight times the Euclidean distance of each member of the convex hull from the facility location, which comes by solving single-facility location problem (SFLP) for the fixed points in that hull.
